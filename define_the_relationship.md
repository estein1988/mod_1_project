Project: Mod1 Project - Hiking in Colorado

Group Member: Elliott, Sanjeev

Project Expectations: Build a fully function CLI app, that allows users to connect to their favorite hikes and review them.

Goals: Be done with MVP (minimal viable product) by end-of-day Tuesday and complete app by Wednesday. Add additional features on Thursday. Create video and readme Friday.

Strengths: Both of us have completed the CLI app creation in the pre-work, so feel like we have a good understanding of basic CLI functionality.

Schedule Expectations: Attempt to complete everything between the hours of 9:00AM to 6:00PM, but work after 6:00PM if we feel like we need to. Sanjeev will be out from ~ 12pm to 2pm for a meeting, so may need to work extra Thursday night. 

Communication Expectations: Slack and Zoom.

Workload expectations: Always try to work on everything together, rather than independently. Ensure that Git and Github workflow is working perfectly.

Workflow expectations: Tackle each section in verticle slices, track all changes through Git.

Giving and receiving feedback: Be mindful and courteous of each person's opinion's and knowledge at this point in the course.

Agenda to discuss project launch: 

Ideas: Hiking project, Movies and reviews, travelers and destinations. 

Tools: VS Code, Git, Github

Additional Notes: Likely will chose hiking project. Changing this file for testing to push up to new branch.
